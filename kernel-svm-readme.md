# 🚀 Kernel SVM Classification Project

Welcome to my Kernel SVM Classification project! 🌟 This project demonstrates how to build a classification model using a Kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict user behavior based on social network advertisements.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze social network data and predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary. The dataset used here is **Social_Network_Ads.csv**.

## 🔍 Key Steps in the Project

### 1. 📥 Data Importing
We start by importing essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, and then load the dataset.

### 2. 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
- Feature scaling to standardize the values, which helps improve model performance.

### 3. 🧠 Model Training
We use the **Kernel SVM** model with an RBF kernel to capture non-linear relationships in the data.

### 4. 🔮 Prediction
The trained model is then used to predict outcomes for the test set.

### 5. 📏 Model Evaluation
- **Confusion Matrix**: To evaluate the accuracy of predictions.
- **Accuracy Score**: To assess the overall performance.

### 6. 📈 Visualization
We visualize decision boundaries and data distributions for both the training and test sets using Matplotlib.

## 🎯 Results
The model effectively distinguishes between potential buyers and non-buyers, offering valuable insights into customer behavior.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced
- Optimizing hyperparameters for better performance.
- Ensuring proper scaling for better visualization.

## 🌱 Learning Outcomes
- Enhanced understanding of SVM and kernel techniques.
- Improved data visualization and model evaluation skills.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning framework
